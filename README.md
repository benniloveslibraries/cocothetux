Coco's personal website

I made a website for my cat today. I'm sure this is perfectly normal behavior.

This was a solo project, though Coco would probably like to take some credit for my work. She did read "JavaScript for Cats" earlier this term, after all. There isn't actually any JavaScript in this project, but she's a cat so I don't think she cares.
